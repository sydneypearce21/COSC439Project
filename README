OS Final Project : Memory Management Simulation

Names: Milan Black, Andrew Fleming, Sydney Pearce


Build Instructions: Makefile included

Run Instructions:
    --> java Main
    --> instructions will then be provided
    --> choose your fit to display (first, best, next, worst)
    --> output simulation of that memory fit will display

Submitted Files:
 - Main.java: 
     Main entry point for simulator.
 - Externals.java:
     Contains commonly-used constants and functions
 - Process.java: 
     Models a process in memory
 - MemorySimulatorBase.java: 
     Contains functionality shared by all memory management strategies
 - FirstFitMemorySimulator.java:
     Employs a first-fit memory management strategy
 - BestFitMemorySimulator.java
     Employs a best-fit memory management strategy
 - NextFitMemorySimulator.java
